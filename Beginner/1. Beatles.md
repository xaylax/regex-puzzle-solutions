1. `HE|LL|O+` means either `(HE) OR (LL) OR (O 1 or more times)` can be matched against
2. `[PLEASE]+` means the word `PLEASE` 1 or more times (cause of the `+`)
3. `[^SPEAK]+` means not `S, P, E, A, K`, so we can't match against any of these letters
4. `EP|IP|EF|` means either `(EP) OR (IP) OR (EF)` can be matched against

- the bottom left square is the easiest so let's tackle it first: the only letter NOT in `SPEAK` but in `PLEASE` is `L`
- for the top row, we know it has to be `H E` or `L L` or `O O` due to the `HE|LL|O+` clue
  - it can't be `L L` or `O O` because neither of those letters are in the `EP|IP|EF` clue
  - so the top row is `H E`
- the bottom right square has to work with the `EP|IP|EF` clue and since the first letter is an E, it can either be `EP` or `EF`
  - but there's no `F` in `[PLEASE]+` which the letter also has to satisfy
  - so the bottom row is `L P`
  
- ... and we get HELP!
