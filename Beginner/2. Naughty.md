1. `.*M?O.*	` means `any character, M 0 or 1 times, O, any character` can be matched against (in that order?)
2. `(AN|FE|BE)` means either `(AN) OR (FE) OR (BE)` can be matched against
3. `(A|B|C)\1	` means `A OR B OR C`, can be matched against multiple times (the `/1` means backreference so matching what's in the capturing group exactly)
4. `(AB|OE|SK)` means either `(AB) OR (OE) OR (SK)` can be matched against

- the bottom row can be `(AN) OR (FE) OR (BE)` if we just consider the `(AN|FE|BE)` clue
  - we can eliminate `AN` because the `(AB|OE|SK)` clue going down tells us that the 2nd letter needs to be in one of those OR clauses (and `N` isn't, but `E` is)
  - we can eliminate `FE` because the `(A|B|C)\1` clue going down tells us the first letter needs to be either `A OR B OR C`, which `FE` doesn't satisfy
  - so the bottom row has to be `BE`
- the top left square can either be `AA OR BB OR CC` because of the `/1`, but since we already know the 2nd letter from the previous clue, `B`, the top left square must be `B`
- the top right square needs to satisfy `AB OR OE OR SK` down and since we already have the 2nd letter, `E` from out previous steps, we know the first letter has to be `O`
  
**... and we get BOBE!**
