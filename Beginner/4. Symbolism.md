1. `[*]+` means `*` can be matched against 1 or more times
2. `/+` means `/` can be matched against 1 or more times
3. `.?.+` means `any character 0 or 1 times, any character 1 or more times`, can be matched against
4. `.+` means `any character 1 or more times` can be matched against

- the top-left square has to be `*` because of the `[*]+` clue
- the bottom-left square has to be `/` because of the `/+` clue
- since both of these clues have a `+` at the end, and the clues going down essentially allow for any character, we just repeat the character in the 1st column in the 2nd column
  
**... and we get ** //!**
