1. `(.)+\1` means any character can be matched against multiple times (the `/1` means backreference so matching what's in the capturing group exactly)
2. `[^ABRC]+` means the letters in `ABRC` can't be matched against
3. `[COBRA]+` means `C O B R A`, can be matched against
4. `(AB|O|OR)+` means either `(AB) OR (O) OR (OR)` can be matched against

- starting with the right-most column, using the `(AB|O|OR)+` clue, the column can be `AB OR O[another letter] OR OR`
  - but the `[^ABRC]+` clue corresponding to the bottom-right square says that we can't match against `B OR R`, so we can eliminate the `AB & OR` pairings
  - so `OO` goes in the right column, because `O` is the bottom-right square and the `+` at the end of the clue says the letter can repeat
- the top-left square has to be `O` because of the `/1` in the `(.)+\1` clue. 
  - it means that whatever's in the first square in the top row, has to repeat in the 2nd square
  - since the 2nd square (top-right) is `O`, the first one has to be `O` too
- the bottom-left square is whatever letter's not in `ABRC` but is in `COBRA`, which is `O`
  
**... and we get OOOO!**
