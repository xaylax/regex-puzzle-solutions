1. `CAT|FOR|FAT` means `CAT OR FOR OR FAT` can be matched
2. `RY|TY\-` means first either `RY OR TY` gets matched and then `-`
3. `[TOWEL]*` means `T,O,W,E,L` gets matched 0 or more times
4. `.(.)\1` means any character gets matched 
5. `.*[WAY]+` means any character gets matched 0 or more times, then `W,A,Y` gets matched 1 or more times
6. `[RAM].[OH]` means `R,A,M` gets matched, then any character, then `O,H`

- in `RAM` and of the options of 1, only `FOR` works, because that's the only one that ends with `R`
- `-` is the last square in the 2nd row
- last 2 squares in last row are `W` and `O` because those letters are common in clue 3 and 5,6
- for the rest of the squares, there were multiple options, so I just tried different letters until I came up with an actual word
  
**... and we get FORTY-TWO!**
