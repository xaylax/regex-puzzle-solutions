1. `[AWE]+` means `AWE` can be matched 1 or more times
2. `[ALP]+K` means `ALP` can be matched 1 or more times first and then `K`
3. `PR|ER|EP` means `PR OR ER OR EP` can be matched
4. `[BQW](PR|LE)` means `BQW` is matched first and then `PR OR LE`
5. `[RANK]+` means `RANK` can be matched 1 or more times

- the only letter that's in the `BQW` part of clue 4 and clue 1 is W, so that goes in the top left
- for top right, the only letter both in 1 and 5 is A, so A is the top right
- 2nd row right is K based on clue 2
- we eliminate `EP` option from 3 because `P` isn't in 5
- we elimiate `PR` option from 4 because that would result in `RR` in the bottom row, which isn't an option in clue 3. 
  - That leaves us with `ER` for the last row and `LE` down the first column
  
**... and we get WALKER!**
