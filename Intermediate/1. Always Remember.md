1. `[NOTAD]*` means `NOTAD` can be matched 0 or more times
2. `WEL|BAL|EAR` means `WEL OR BAL OR EAR` can be matched
3. `UB|IE|AW` means `UB OR IE OR AW` can be matched
4. `[TUBE]*` means `T,U,B,E` can be matched 0 or more times
5. `[BORF]*` means `B,O,R,F` is be matched first, then any digit (`.`)

- starting with the bottom row, if we look at clues 2 and 3, any of 3's combos could work, but then we notice that only `AW`'s first digit `A` is present in clue 1. 
  - so, bottom row is `WEL`, first letter in top row is `A` 
- then, seeing what letters clues 1 and 4 and 1 and 5 have in common, we get `ATO` for the top row
  
**... and we get ATOWEL**
