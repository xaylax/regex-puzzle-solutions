1. `18|19|20` means `18 OR 19 OR 20` can be matched
2. `[6789]\d` means `6,7,8,9` can be matched first, and the second digit can be anything
3. `\d[2480]` means the first digit is anything, and the second digit would be `2,4,8,0`
4. `56|94|73` means `56 OR 94 OR 73` can be matched

- let's start with the top row - if we look at the digit that's in common with the last digit of the options in the top left and the options in the top right, it's `9`.
  - so `9` goes in the top right square
- next, the first digit corresponding to the `9` from the options in the top left is `1`, so the top row is `19`
- for the bottom right, we take the second digit from the option we selected that had `9` as its first digit, so it's `94` down
- the only digit in common from the bottom left and top left is `8`, so that goes in the bottom left 
  
**... and we get 1984**
